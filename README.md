  <h1>Ilaria Audio Analyzer 💖</h1>
</p>

🎉 Welcome to Ilaria Audio Analyzer! 🎉  
  
This project leverages various libraries and modules to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for advanced audio analysis.  
It's primarily designed for use with HuggingFace Spaces. 🤗   

Ilaria Audio Analyzer is part of the Ilaria AI Suite wich includes various easy and powerful tools. 💖

## 📦 Installation 📦

To use this project, clone the original Space on Hugging Face.  
Make sure you restart it time to time to keep up with the new updates.

## 🖥️ Usage 🖥️

From there, you can utilize the various features of the project.

## 🌟 Features 🌟

Ilaria Audio Analyzer offers a range of features, including:

- 📊 **Spectrogram Creation**:  
Ilaria Audio Analyzer uses the matplotlib.pyplot module to create a spectrogram of the audio data.
It uses the specgram function to generate the spectrogram and saves it to a PNG file.

- 🌍 **User-Friendly Web Interface**:  
Ilaria Audio Analyzer uses the gradio module to create an intuitive web interface.
Users can easily upload an audio file, and the application will return the spectrogram of the audio and the audio file info.

- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Web Interface**:  
Ilaria Audio Analyzer uses the gradio module to create an intuitive web interface.
Users can easily upload an image, and the application will return the upscaled and restored image.

- 📂 **Efficient File Handling**:  
Ilaria Audio Analyzer uses the os and tempfile modules for efficient file handling operations.
It saves the spectrogram to a PNG file and returns the path of the PNG file.

- 📝 **Detailed Audio Information**:  
  Ilaria Audio Analyzer provides detailed information about the audio file, including the file name, duration, bitrate, number of audio channels, samples per second, and bits per second.
This information is presented in a well-formatted table for easy reading.
